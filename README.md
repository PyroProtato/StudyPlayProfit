## Description 
StudyPlayProfit is a game app aimed at making study more fun! Studying gets you tickets and diamonds which you can spend on games to earn more diamonds or to pull for boosts that will increase various aspects of the game! This project was made using React Native and Expo, which is a framework that allows for projects on iOS, Android, and the Web.

## Background
When I saw the cider announcement, I found it really cool that I could put an app of my own on the App Store. I tried to think of a few ideas for apps that would help my life in some way. Eventually I realized that I was thinking so hard in order to procrastinate studying for my upcoming test -_-. Boom, the idea for this app appeared. Build an app that would make studying fun! Although this was a really ironic way to fix this problem (since by working on it I was actively procrastinating other things) I had a lot of fun and I feel like I learned a lot!
